## 🚀 Overview

This visualization tool helps engineers understand Reth's complex architecture through interactive simulations, animations, and step-by-step explanations of core systems.

### Features

- **Interactive Simulations**: Visualize Engine API flow, state root computation, and transaction processing
- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Progressive chapters that build understanding from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- **Real-time Animations**: See how data flows through Reth's systems in real-time
- **Code Examples**: Actual Rust code snippets showing implementation details
- **Performance Metrics**: Understand timing and optimization strategies

## 📚 Chapters

1. **Overview**: The big picture of Ethereum execution architecture
2. **Engine API**: Understanding newPayload and forkchoiceUpdated flows
3. **State Root Computation**: Sparse, Parallel, and Sequential strategies (Coming Soon)
4. **Trie Architecture**: TrieWalker, caching, and optimization techniques (Coming Soon)
5. **Transaction Journey**: From mempool to finalized block (Coming Soon)
